# Chopped Liver
**Yield:** about 2 cups
**Prep Time:** 10 min
**Cook Time:** 30 min

## Ingredients
- 0.5 lbs calf liver, thin sliced, trim any connective tissue
- 1 large yellow onion, diced
- 1 hard boiled egg (11.5 min)
- Butter
- 2 sprigs thyme, removed stem
- Pepper
- Salt

## Procedure
1. Sauté onions in butter until translucent just starting to brown (salt)
2. Add liver to pan. Salt and pepper liver. Add thyme.
3. Brown liver on both sides until cooked through.
4. Remove onions and liver and let cool a little. 
5. Chop in food processor with egg to desired texture. Make sure to get the liquid from the pan into the food processor. 

## Notes
- Frozen liver seems to be fine
- Make sure there is enough liquid so it’s not too dry. Additional butter might help or maybe a splash of stock/broth?
