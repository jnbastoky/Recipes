# Pot Roast
**Yield:** 4-6 servings
**Prep Time:** 45 minutes
**Cook Time:** 3.5 hours

## Ingredients
- Beef chuck-eye roast
- 1 onion, chopped
- 1 small carrot, chopped
- 1 small celery stalk, chopped
- 2 garlic cloves, crushed
- 2 tsps, sugar
- 1-1/4 cup low-sodium chicken broth
- 1-1/4 cup beef broth
- 1 sprig fresh thyme
- 1/4 cup Cabernet Sauvignon 

## Procedure
### Prep
1. Preheat oven to 300 F
2. Pat dry roast
3. Salt and pepper roast
4. Tie with twine if needed to maintain shape. (I think this just got in the way and reduces surface area for browning.)

### Brown Vegetables & Roast
1. Heat oil in Dutch oven on medium-high heat
2. Brown roast on all sides (8-10 minutes)
3. Remove beef from Dutch oven
4. Reduce heat to medium
5. Add onion, celery. and carrots. Stir until brown (6-8 minutes)
6. Add garlic and sugar and stir for about 30 seconds until fragant
7. Add 1 cup of stock and thyme.
8. Stir and scrape pan.
9. Add roast back to Dutch over.
10. Add water until half way up the side of the roast.
11. Cover pot tightly with aluminum foil and lid.
12. Bring to simmer over medium heat.
13. Transfer pot to oven.
14. Cook for 3.5-4 hours until tender, flipping roast even 30 minutes. (Added additional beef broth early on because the liquid was getting low.)

### Sauce
1. Remove roast from pot and tent with foil.
2. Let liquid settle for 5 minute and skim oil/fat.
3. Remove Thyme.
4. Boil over medium-high heat until reduced to 1.5 cups (about 8 minutes).
5. Add wine and reduce to 1.5 cups.
6. Season with salt and pepper.
7. Add roast to back to pot and pull apart into chunks.  Toss in the sauce.
