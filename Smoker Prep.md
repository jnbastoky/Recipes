# Smoker Prep
Getting a consistent amount of smoke out of the grill is hard. Initially, I usually get too much smoke. 

1. Place smoker box directly on burner smoker bars.
2. Fill smoker box half full of chips.
3. Turn grill to high.
4. Let the wood turn to embers. This will probably make a ton of smoke.
5. Add fresh chips on top of embers. This will produce a good amount of smoke but wonâ€™t be overwhelming.
