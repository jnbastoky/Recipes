## Procedure
1. Brown beef in a large cast iron skillet. Salt.
     It doesn't have to be completely cooked through at this point--don't overcook it.
3. Saute onions and bell pepper in dutch oven until browned.  Salt.
    1. Use neutral oil like avocado oil.
    2. This isn't quite to the point of caramalization but it's getting there.
    3. Make sure to scrape the bottom as you go.
    4. This takes a while.
    5. Add garlic when its almost done browning.
5. Remove from heat and add Phase 1 Spices.
6. Add 2 cups of bone broth and scrape the bottom of the pan.
7. Add tomatoes and beef (including in fat/juices in the pan.)
8. Bring to a boil.
9. Simmer to reduce
10. Add Phase 2 Spices and 1 cup of bone broth
11. Simmer and reduce
12. Add 1 cup of bone broth
13. Simmer and reduce
14. It's done when you can move a spoon from the front to the back of the dutch oven and briefly see the bottom of the pan.  It's shouldn't be soupy at this point.
15. Add vinegar


## Notes
- Brown the beef while the onions and bell peppers are cooking to save some time
- Can add a tsp of baking soda to a little water and toss the beef in it to get a little more browning.
- Could you add all the spices at the beginning?  Probably
