# Grilled Chicken Thighs
**Yield:** 4
**Prep Time:** 5 min
**Cook Time:** 20 min

## Ingredients
- 2 lb chicken thighs
- 100 ml white vinegar
- 4 tbsp olive oil
- 3 tbsp McCormick® Grill Mates® Roasted Garlic & Herb Seasoning

## Procedure
1. Preheat grill to medium-low
2. Mix vinegar, olive, and seasoning in a bowl large enough to hold chicken
3. Add chicken and make sure thighs are coated
4. Let sit for 5-10 minutes. (If I marinate for longer I don’t think I get as good of browning on the grill since the vinegar is probably reducing the pH.)
5. Oil grill grates
6. Place thighs directly over burners
7. Flip after 10 minutes. The edges should be starting to turn reddish-brown.
8. Cook another 8-12 minutes depending on size to internal temperature of 160F. Thighs should be have reddish brown color.
